# Machine Learning for Powder Diffraction of Quasicrystals

Supporting Information for the paper "Deep learning enables rapid identification of a previously unknown quasicrystal solely from multiphase powder diffraction patterns"
 
## Repository
In this repository, we provide an implementation of MLqcdiff models.

1. Compile the generator.pyx: `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`
2. Run the training.py to train the models
3. Run the screening.py to screen dataset of powder XRD patterns
